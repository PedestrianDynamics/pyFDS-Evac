## [Unreleased]

### Changed

Defaults now follow FDS+Evac where a mechanism has a direct FDS+Evac
counterpart ([#157](https://github.com/PedestrianDynamics/pyFDS-Evac/issues/157)).
See [Defaults follow FDS+Evac](https://pedestriandynamics.org/pyFDS-Evac/docs/getting-started/coming-from-fds-evac/#defaults-follow-fdsevac).

- Smoke, heat and visibility are sampled at 1.6 m (`HUMAN_SMOKE_HEIGHT`)
  instead of 2.0 m.
- The irritant (FIC) slowdown is off by default. `--enable-fic-speed` turns it
  on.
- The HCN term of the FED subtracts NO + NO2 and uses the offset 1/220, as the
  FDS `FED` function that FDS+Evac calls, instead of NO2 alone with 0.0045
  (FDS+Evac Guide Eq. 15)
  ([#159](https://github.com/PedestrianDynamics/pyFDS-Evac/issues/159)).
- The O2 term of the FED applies below 20 % O2 instead of 19.5 %.
  `--o2-threshold-percent` sets the threshold.
- A spawn area that sets no pre-movement gets a constant 10 s (`PRE_MEAN`),
  with a warning, instead of 0 s. A `constant` pre-movement distribution is
  added.
- A spawn area that sets no `v0` walks at 1.25 m/s (`VEL_MEAN`) instead of
  1.2 m/s.
- The convective heat dose is off by default. `--enable-heat-fed` turns it on;
  before, it was on whenever the FDS output had a `TEMPERATURE` slice.

**Migration.** To reproduce results from earlier pyFDS-Evac versions, pass
`--smoke-slice-height 2.0 --enable-fic-speed --o2-threshold-percent 19.5
--enable-heat-fed` to `run.py` (or set the matching `opts` attributes), and
give every spawn area `"use_premovement": false` and `"v0": 1.2` unless it
already sets them. Python callers that build the models themselves pass
`TenabilityConfig(enable_fic_speed=True)`,
`DefaultFedConfig(o2_threshold_percent=19.5, slice_height_m=2.0)`, and
`slice_height_m=2.0` to `SmokeSpeedConfig`, `ExtinctionField.from_fds`,
`FdsHeatField.from_fds` and `VisibilityModel`; a heat dose needs a
`DefaultHeatFedModel` passed to `run_scenario`, as before. The earlier HCN form is not available: it was a
documentation error in the FDS+Evac Guide, and it differs from the current
one only when NO is present or by the offset, 4.5 × 10⁻⁵ /min.
